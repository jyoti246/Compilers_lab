1. We need to declare a variable before assigning the return value of a function call
2. Pointers is parsed properly, but having problems in displaying them
3. declarations inside loops isn't allowed.
4. u cant read 0 as an i/p, that's restricted
5. u cant keep t* as variable name, those are compiler generated temporaries.
6. There is a little problem with printStr, as we cant define a char array
